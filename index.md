4. Over the weekend, be sure to go out and pay attention to the security of anything that is related to money. Discuss what you observed and how Argentines protect their money, especially anything that might be hackable.

### In addition to the normal stuff, be sure to pack all of the following in your carry-on bag (not your checked luggage.)
